Introducing the Skill Nation Challenge app! Upon opening the app, you'll immediately notice the two types of currency available: leafs, the standard currency, and dew, the premium currency. Scroll down to explore all of the exciting items available for purchase.

Selecting an item will take you to the descriptions screen, where you can view the item's stats and choose to buy it with the green button or return to the Items screen with the red button. Should you decide to purchase the item, a prompt will appear asking you to confirm the purchase.

If you don't have the required funds or already own the item, a warning will appear.


To run the app run on the console : "npm i" to install all the dependencies and then "npm start" to run the application on the desired emulator.
